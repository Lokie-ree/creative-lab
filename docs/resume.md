## Summary

Veteran math educator with 10+ years of classroom experience, an advanced mathematics degree, and self-taught full-stack development skills. I design interactive learning experiences that treat formulas as destinations to be earned through discovery, not prerequisites to be memorized. Currently building AI-powered coaching tools for Louisiana educators and interactive mathematics modules that demonstrate pedagogical approaches aligned with modern learning science.

## Interactive Teaching Online

**Pelican AI** — Founder & Developer  
*2025 – Present*

Built an intelligent coaching layer that helps Louisiana teachers generate high-quality, context-aligned prompts for AI tools. Currently serving active users during beta testing.

- Designed conversational interface that gathers pedagogical context through natural dialogue rather than form-filling
- Integrated Louisiana Educator Rubric, Louisiana Student Standards, and LEADS evaluation framework into prompt generation
- Created feedback loops where successful prompts become shareable exemplars for other educators
- Tech stack: React, Convex backend, GPT integration with Louisiana-specific RAG

**Creative Lab: Sine/Cosine Interactive Module** — In Development  
*December 2025*

Designing an interactive visualization where users discover the wave equation by matching a target motion—formula appears as reward, not prerequisite.

- Users immediately engage with synchronized unit circle, wave graph, and pulsing glow visualization
- Pattern-matching challenge teaches amplitude, frequency, and phase through intuition
- No front-loaded explanations—the interface teaches through invitation to tinker
- Built with React, Three.js, GSAP, achieving 60fps mathematical animations

## Relevant Strengths

**Mathematical Depth**  
Advanced degree with coursework spanning calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra, analysis, and beyond. Comfortable teaching foundational through advanced topics.

**Pedagogical Instinct**  
Nearly two decades of watching students hit walls and finding ways around them. Understanding of where learners get lost and how to sequence experiences that build genuine comprehension.

**Technical Execution**  
Self-taught developer who ships working products. Able to prototype ideas quickly and iterate based on real user feedback.

**Content Creation**  
Strong writing skills developed through years of explaining complex ideas clearly. Experience creating instructional materials that are visual, progressive, and intuitive.

**Adaptability**  
Comfortable pivoting between classroom teaching, technology coordination, mentoring, and development work. Thrive in environments requiring experimentation and iteration.

## Philosophy

I believe mathematical understanding should be earned through discovery, not delivered through explanation. The best learning experiences drop users into challenges that feel intuitive, then reveal the underlying structure after they've developed genuine insight. Formulas should feel like rewards—confirmation of something you've already understood—not arbitrary rules to memorize.
