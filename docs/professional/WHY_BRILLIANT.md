# Why Are You Interested in Brilliant?

## Form Response (Ready to Copy-Paste)

I've spent over 15 years watching students hit walls. Not the kind that means they can't learn—the kind that mean we've taught it wrong.

The moment I started using Brilliant as a learner, I recognized something familiar: you treat formulas as destinations, not entrances. That's the same instinct I've been fighting for in Louisiana classrooms since 2010. When I teach sine waves, I don't start with y = A sin(Bx + C). I start with a spinning point, a shadow on the wall, a rhythm students can feel before they can name it. The formula comes later—as confirmation of something they've already understood.

Your values resonate: adventure, excellence, generosity, candor. I'm an optimist who takes pride in craft. I go the extra mile because the work matters. I tell it like it is because that's how trust gets built.

I also believe what you're building changes lives. I've seen students who "hate math" light up when they finally *get* something—not because they memorized a rule, but because they discovered a pattern. Brilliant scales that moment to millions of learners. That's the work I want to do.

I'm a mathematician above all. But I've spent more than 15 years as an educator learning about how students learn. As a former computer science major who returned to coding in 2024, I've combined mathematical depth, pedagogical knowledge, and technical skills to build interactive learning experiences.

That combination—mathematician, classroom teacher, builder—is what I bring to Brilliant. I understand where students get lost because I've watched it happen thousands of times. I know how to sequence experiences that build genuine comprehension. And I can prototype and ship.

The interactive module I've built demonstrates how I'd approach Brilliant's expansion into higher-level mathematics—trigonometry, linear algebra, differential equations—by creating experiences that make mathematical thinking feel like discovery, not memorization.

I'd welcome the chance to show you how I think about interactive math education. The module demonstrates my approach; a conversation would let me show you how I'd apply it across the range of concepts your learners encounter.

## Alternative Shorter Version (If character limit is tight)

I've spent 15+ years teaching math, watching students hit walls not because they can't learn, but because we've taught it wrong. When I discovered Brilliant, I recognized something familiar: you treat formulas as destinations, not entrances. That's the same instinct I've been fighting for in Louisiana classrooms since 2010.

I'm a mathematician who teaches, codes, and thinks pedagogically about interactive design. That rare combination—mathematical depth, 15+ years of classroom experience, and full-stack development skills—is what I bring to Brilliant.

I understand where students get lost because I've watched it happen thousands of times. I know how to sequence experiences that build genuine comprehension. And I can prototype and ship. The interactive module I've built demonstrates my approach: challenge before explanation, intuition before notation, formula as earned insight.

Brilliant scales the moment when a student finally *gets* something—not through memorization, but through discovery. That's the work I want to do.
