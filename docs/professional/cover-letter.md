*Math Producer Application — Brilliant*

Dear Brilliant Team,

I've spent over a decade watching students hit walls. Not the kind that mean they can't learn—the kind that mean we've taught it wrong.

The moment I started using Brilliant as a learner, I recognized something familiar: you treat formulas as destinations, not entrances. That's the same instinct I've been fighting for in Louisiana classrooms since 2010. When I teach sine and cosine, I don't start with y = A sin(Bx + C). I start with a spinning point, a shadow on the wall, a rhythm students can feel before they can name it. The formula comes later—as confirmation of something they've already understood.

That philosophy is why I'm applying for this role, and why I built something to show you what I mean.

**The Interactive Module**

I've created a sine/cosine visualization where users discover the wave equation by matching a target motion. There's no front-loaded explanation. Users land on a synchronized unit circle, wave graph, and pulsing glow—plus a ghost target they need to match. They drag sliders. Things move. *Oh, that's what amplitude does.* When they nail the match, the formula appears as a reward, not a prerequisite.

This is how I believe mathematical concepts should be taught: challenge before explanation, intuition before notation, formula as earned insight.

**Why I'm a Fit**

I hold an Master of Science in Mathematics from Nicholls State University. I've taught grades 6–12 across algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and precalculus. I've served as a mentor teacher training colleagues, a technology facilitator pioneering digital tools in classrooms, and a 504 coordinator balancing large, complex workloads across competing priorities.

I'm also a self-taught full-stack developer. This year, I built Pelican AI—an intelligent coaching platform that helps Louisiana teachers generate context-aligned prompts for AI tools. It integrates the Louisiana Educator Rubric, Louisiana Student Standards, and LEADS evaluation framework into a conversational interface. It has active users. It works.

That combination—mathematician, classroom teacher, builder—is what I bring to Brilliant. I understand where students get lost because I've watched it happen thousands of times. I know how to sequence experiences that build genuine comprehension. And I can prototype and ship.

**What Draws Me to Brilliant**

Your values resonate: adventure, excellence, generosity, candor. I'm an optimist who takes pride in craft. I go the extra mile because the work matters. I tell it like it is because that's how trust gets built.

I also believe what you're building changes lives. I've seen students who "hate math" light up when they finally *get* something—not because they memorized a rule, but because they discovered a pattern. Brilliant scales that moment to millions of learners. That's the work I want to do.

**The Ask**

I'd welcome the chance to show you how I think about interactive math education. The module I've built demonstrates my approach; a conversation would let me show you how I'd apply it across the range of concepts your learners encounter.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Randall LaPoint, Jr.
